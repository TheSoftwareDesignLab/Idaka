For more details please refer to [MongoDB_Documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/basics/create-database)
#### Create the collections on the created database
Once you created the database, the following step will be creating the required collections for the app. For this, navigate to the Collections tab and click on the Create collection button.

It would be neccesary to create 4 collections: Practices, Queries, Stages, TasksWithPractices.

For more details please refer to [MongoDB_Documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-ui/collections/)
#### CollectionsÂ´ Data Uploads
The following data needs to be uploaded on their corresponding collections:
* [Practices](DB%20Data/Practices.json)
* [Stages](DB%20Data/Stages.json)
* [TasksWithPractices](DB%20Data/TasksWithPractices.json)

In order to do this you should go to your collection and click on Insert Document. Select the JSON way to upload, and copy/paste the corresponding data.

### 2. Configure the environment variables 
On the back-end folder create a .env file with the variable REACT_APP_DB_CONNECTION_STRING. Note that you should add the connection string for the database.
For more details please refer to [MongoDB_Documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/basics/mongodb-connection-string#:~:text=In%20the%20MongoDB%20Atlas%20web,connection%20string%20for%20your%20cluster.)


### 3. Download and compile Idaka with the following commands.
```
git clone https://github.com/TheSoftwareDesignLab/Idaka.git

To run the back-end:
```
cd Back-end
npm i
npm start
```
Now by opening another terminal, to run front-end:
